# Hazel Clone

Hazel Clone is my recreation of the Hazel engine for educational purposes. The Hazel engine is created by The Cherno and his video series can be found [here](https://thecherno.com/engine) and the original repository can be found [here](https://github.com/TheCherno/Hazel).

From the Hazel repo's README:
> Hazel is primarily an early-stage interactive application and rendering engine for Windows.
> The plan for Hazel is two-fold: to create a powerful 3D engine, but also to serve as an education tool for teaching game engine design and architecture.

Commits will include an 'End of video:' message to map commits to each video in The Cherno's series.
