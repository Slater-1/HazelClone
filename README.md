# Hazel Clone

Hazel Clone is my recreation of the Hazel engine for educational purposes. The Hazel engine is created by The Cherno and his video series can be found [here](https://thecherno.com/engine) and the original repository can be found [here](https://github.com/TheCherno/Hazel).

From the Hazel repo's README:
> Hazel is primarily an early-stage interactive application and rendering engine for Windows.
> The plan for Hazel is two-fold: to create a powerful 3D engine, but also to serve as an education tool for teaching game engine design and architecture.

Commits may be overly verbose to log my own understanding of the material. Commits that map to the end of a video in the web series will  include an 'End of video:' message to map that commit to a video in The Cherno's series.
